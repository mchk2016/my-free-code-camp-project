            <h1>Extracts from "Our Cats, by Harrison Weir"</h1>
            <h3>Usefulness of cats</h3>
            <p>We recently participated in #MuseumCats Day on Twitter and this involved a quick search through our 
            holdings for some interesting pictures of cats to Tweet and what a gem we have found! Please enjoy this 
            selection of wonderful and [in some cases] bizarre illustrations of cats from the book "Our Cats and all 
            about them" written and illustrated by Harrison Weir in 1889. </p>

            <p>My personal favourites are the surreal disembodied heads [see above], "Sylvie" [she of the magnificent 
            moustaches] and the Russian cat who [in my opinion] has a most unsettling human expression.</p>
            <blockquote>
                The cat, with eyne of burning coal, 
                Now crouches before the mouse a hole.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Weir was a very interesting character; he was born in 1824 on May 5th [d.1906], and is known as "The Father 
            of the Cat Fancy”. He organizied the first ever cat show in England, at The Crystal Palace, London in July 1871 
            where he and his brother served as judges. In 1887 he founded the National Cat Club and was its first President 
            and Show Manager until his resignation in 1890. Our Cats was the first published pedigree cat book.</p>
